        <h3>Review Points for Website</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The link I was provided led straight to their ITIS 3135 homepage with all their links. I took a look at all their links and found the Client Project link which led me straight to their website.</li>
            <li>No obvious spaces or uppercase letters in URLs or file names.</li>
            <li>Good design:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sufficient contrast and font sizing, the text was very easy to read.</li>
                    <li>Consistent color scheme and fonts. I checked their GitHub and saw they used a separate CSS file for their styles.</li>
                    <li>All CRAP principles followed (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Header, main content, and footer are present!</li>
            <li>Navigation menu was in between header and main content visually and within the code. </li>
            <li>Header contains the site/brand name correctly.</li>
            <li>This was not a homework page, so they didn't need to list student information.</li>
            <li>Main content starts with a heading(h2), Introducing the user to VOICE. The student understood the difference between head, header, and heading.</li>
            <li>Brand tagline was not clearly visible? I do see some taglines but they are not consistent on every page.</li>
            <li>Footer exists but does not include a menu for user pages, only the branding link (the whimsical company), which is acceptable here.</li>
            <li>Has the HTML validation link.</li>
            <li>Has the CSS validation link.</li>
            <li>Overall structure, style, and organization are very strong! It is very easy to navigate!</li>
            <li>There are many different pages with working navigation links.</li>
            <li>The navigation bar is very noticeable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Plenty of images bring more life and energy to the pages.</li>
            <li>Have the interactive elements that were needed for this project. They have a form that users can use to submit information, and a slideshow! However, I think the project assignment wants us to have 3 interactive elements, so they should add one more for safe measures!</li>
            <li>They have plenty of interactive links.</li>
        </ul>
