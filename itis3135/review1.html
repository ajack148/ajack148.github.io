        <h3>Review Points for Website</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The link led straight to their ITIS 3135 homepage with all their links! I was able to find the webpage easily that way.</li>
            <li>No obvious spaces or uppercase letters in URLs or file names.</li>
            <li>Good design:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sufficient contrast and font sizing, the text was very easy to read.</li>
                    <li>Consistent color scheme and fonts. I checked their GitHub and saw they used a separate CSS file for their styles.</li>
                    <li>All CRAP principles followed (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Header, main content, and footer are present!</li>
            <li>Navigation menu was not strictly between header and main content. It seems like it was visually within the header, but in the code, it was inside the main section.</li>
            <li>Header contains the site/brand name correctly.</li>
            <li>This was not a homework page, so they didn't need to list student information.</li>
            <li>Main content starts with a heading (h1) and subheading (h2). The student understood the difference between head, header, and heading.</li>
            <li>Brand tagline was not clearly visible. If there was one, it was not consistent across every page.</li>
            <li>Footer exists but does not include a menu for user pages, only the branding, which is acceptable here.</li>
            <li>Missing HTML validation link in some pages.</li>
            <li>Missing CSS validation link in some pages.</li>
            <li>Overall structure, style, and organization are very strong!</li>
            <li>There are many different pages with working navigation links.</li>
            <li>The navigation bar is very noticeable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Plenty of images bring more life and energy to the pages.</li>
            <li>Some images do not load (for example, in the "leathersmithing" project section).</li>
            <li>They have interactive elements which I thought was very creative and cool! There was a timeline area where you can click on each year to find out what the client did that specific year. There was also a slider on one of the project pages, however I wasn't sure on what it did. And the contact page had a form where the user could send the client a message.  </li>
