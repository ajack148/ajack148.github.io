        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born in Westbury, New York, and moved away when I was four years old. I was raised in Henderson, North Carolina. I came to Charlotte, NC for my bachelor’s in Computer Science.</li>

            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I worked as a bank teller for two years before going back to school.</li>

            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I attended an early college and earned my high school diploma along with an Associate’s Degree in Arts.</li>

            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I have no experience in web development! I am here to learn!</li>

            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 11</li>

            <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking and Why:</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>ITIS 4350 - Design Prototyping:</strong> I am considering a concentration in UI/UX after taking a Human-Computer Interaction introduction class last semester. I would like to learn more about the process behind prototyping and making low and high-fidelity models.</li>
                <li><strong>STAT 2223 - Elements of Statistics II:</strong> It is a required class, but I have always loved statistics! The first statistics class I took was easy for me.</li>
                <li><strong>ITCS 3166 - Intro to Computer Networks:</strong> I felt like this was important material to learn, especially within the Computer Science field.</li>
                <li><strong>ITSC 2175 - Logic and Algorithms:</strong> This is a required class, but I find the material interesting. I feel like this class will rack my brain as it progresses.</li>
                <li><strong>ITIS 3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development:</strong> I know nothing about web development, and I liked the idea of learning and using it in my future projects!</li>
            </ol>
<ul>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me By:</strong> I love building LEGO sets. I once spent 6-7 hours straight building a set.</li>

            <li><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong> I love seals and red pandas.</li>
