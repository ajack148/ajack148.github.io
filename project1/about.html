          Sarah Parish is an upcoming poet whose debut collection, <em>When It Rains</em>, is a heartfelt journey through memory, emotion, and growth. With raw honesty and lyrical depth, her poems explore the quiet spaces between loss and healing, and the moments we often leave unspoken.

        <p>
          Writing has been her lifelong companion. Ever since she could string sentences together, she's been filling notebooks with reflections, fragments, and feelings. That early passion led her to pursue an English degree, where she deepened her love for language, literature, and poetic form.

          <em>When It Rains</em> is more than just a title, it's a meditation on how storms can both break and renew us. Her poetry speaks to anyone who’s ever felt too much, loved too deeply, or searched for light on the heaviest days.

          Off the page, she’s often found in sunlit corners with a journal in hand, inspired by nature, music, quiet mornings, and the emotional weight of small, ordinary moments. Through her words, she hopes to remind readers that vulnerability is powerful, and that poetry can be a soft place to land.
